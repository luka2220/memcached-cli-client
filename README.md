## Description

Memcached is a free, open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. It is intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by reducing database load. 
It is also in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data retrieved from back end systems with higher latency. It is simple yet powerful.
Its simple design promotes quick deployment, ease of development, and solves many problems facing large data caches. Its relatively simple API is available for most popular languages.
It uses a simple text based network protocol, which makes it a great platform to use to learn how to build network clients and servers.

The goal of this projewct is to create a cli client which is able to iunteract with a memcached server
