## Description

Memcached is a free, open-source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. It is intended to speed up dynamic web applications by reducing database load. 
It is also an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data retrieved from back-end systems with higher latency. It is simple yet powerful.
Its simple design promotes quick deployment, and ease of development, and solves many problems facing large data caches. Its relatively simple API is available for most popular languages.
It uses a simple text-based network protocol, making it a great platform to learn how to build network clients and servers.

The goal of this project is to create a cli client that can interact with the Memcached server
